= Installation into Cygwin

Use Cygwin's `setup-x86.exe` or `setup-x86_64.exe` utility. Run it from command line with the following arguments:

....
setup-x86_64.exe -X -q -s http://igagis.crabdance.com -s http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com -P svgren
....

It should perform all the needed operations without user interaction.
